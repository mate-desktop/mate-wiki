This page describes how to contribute to the MATE Desktop Environment.

## Welcome

Hi! We are the MATE Desktop Team and we are glad you found your way to this page. We always need new people who want to help. Help can be done in many several ways and everyone can help in one way or another. Yes, we said everyone, because the MATE Desktop is composed of so many different bits and pieces; not finding anything that suits you is almost impossible. The most important thing is that you are motivated and have a willingness to learn.

To make the initial steps as easy as possible for you, we set up some tutorials. Currently there are tutorials for [artwork and themes](../../contributing/artwork-and-themes/getting-started/) for [software development](../../contributing/software-development/getting-started/) and for [translation](../../contributing/translation/getting-started/).

## Contact
