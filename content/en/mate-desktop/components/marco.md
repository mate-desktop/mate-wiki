Marco  is  a minimal X window manager that uses GTK+ for drawing window
frames. It is aimed at non-technical users and is designed to integrate
well  with  the  MATE  desktop. Marco is a plain window manager for the
adult in you; Many window managers are like  Marshmallow  Froot  Loops,
Marco  is like Cheerios. It lacks some features that may be expected by
traditional UNIX or other technical users; these users may want to  investigate  other  available window  managers for use with MATE or as a standalone window manager.

Marco supports several somewhat advanced but common  features  such  as
Window  Shading/Roll-Up,  Window/Edge Snapping, Vertical and Horizontal
Maximize, Always-On-Top,  Sloppy/Mouse  Focus  and  Raising,  and  many
more... Well, not a lot, but some more.
