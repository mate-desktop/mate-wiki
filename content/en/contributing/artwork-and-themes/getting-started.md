## Creating Wallpapers

Wallpapers should be relaxing to look at; some people use there computer for long periods of time. The wallpaper therefore should not distract them from whatever they are doing. It is always nice to have some MATE branded wallpapers. There are several great open-source tools to assist you in making things look nice:

- [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) (raster graphics editor used for image manipulation and image editing)
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) (vector graphics editor used to create vector images)

## Creating Themes

The MATE Desktop uses the [GTK+ 3](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/) graphical toolkit.

MATE has evolved from GNOME 2, but some design principles that we follow are still roughly based on the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines 2.3.2:
